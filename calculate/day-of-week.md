# How to Calculate the Day For Any Date
Ever wondered what day your friend's birthday occurred, or whether the next July 4th will be a Thursday?

## Overview
This method uses codes that we add up to get to our final result.

## Calculate It!
As we explain the process, we'll use `December 16, 2482` as an example.

 1. Take the last two digits of the year. In our example, this is `82`.
 2. Divide by 4, and drop any remainder. For us, we do `82 / 4 = 20.5 --> 20`.
 3. Add the date of the month. We'll do `20 + 16 = 36`.
 4. Add the month's value from the [month codes table](#month-codes). In our example, this is `6`, so we do `36 + 6 = 42`.
 5. Add the century code from the [century codes table](#century-codes). In our example, this is `6`, so we do `42 + 6 = 48`.
 6. Add the last two digits of the year. In our example, this was `82`, so we do `48 + 82 = 130`.
 7. Divide by 7 and take the remainder. In our example, this is `130 / 7 = 18r4 --> 4`.
 8. Find your day in the [day codes table](#day-codes). In our example, this is `4 = Wednesday`.
 9. Done!
