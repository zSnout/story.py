# Blocks and States
The core foundation of Storymatic is the block and state system.

## Overview
A block is a collection of statements to run/output. For example, you might have a block about chocolate ice cream, and a block about vanilla ice cream.
A state is an alternative name for blocks, but it is usually used to describe the names of blocks, and the internal state that the program is in.
