Story.py is an amazing story creator that allows you to make interactive, dynamic stories in a very simple manner. The Story.py team has prepared these docs to explain how to write stories. Awesome!

To write a story,
 1. Go to [zSnout's editor](https://zsnout.com/story.py/editor) to create your story. You can directly edit in Trinket, but the editor has syntax highlighting. *This editor has been deprecated.*
 2. Go to [this Trinket](https://trinket.io/embed/python/bdbfb8eeea).
 3. Select the 'adventure' tab.
 4. Replace the contents of the 'adventure' tab with your story.
 5. Press the 'Run' button.
 6. Enjoy!
 7. If you have a Trinket account, you can remix the page to save your story. Otherwise, you may want to sign up to save your story.

Note that Story.py may not work well on mobile devices.
